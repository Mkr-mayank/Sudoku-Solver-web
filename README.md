## Overview

The Sudoku solver program is designed to solve Sudoku puzzles using backtracking. The program prompts the user to enter a 9x9 grid, with each cell containing a number between 1 and 9. Empty cells should be represented by a 0. Once the puzzle is entered, the program solves it using backtracking and displays the solution.

### The challenge

The challenge of this project was to implement the backtracking algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles. The backtracking algorithm is a common algorithm used to solve Sudoku puzzles.

## My process

- Algorithm: The program uses a backtracking algorithm to efficiently solve Sudoku puzzles. It explores possible solutions step by step, backtracking when a solution is no longer valid.
- User Interface: A simple text-based interface allows users to input Sudoku puzzles row by row. Users can use 0 to represent empty cells and separate digits with spaces or tabs.
- Solving: Once the input puzzle is provided, the program processes it and displays the solved Sudoku grid.
- Variable Difficulty: The solver is capable of solving puzzles with varying difficulty levels, making it suitable for both beginners and experienced Sudoku enthusiasts.

### Built with

- Java

### What I learned

Through this project, I learned:
- How to implement the backtracking algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles
- How to prompt the user for input in Java
- How to display output in Java

### Continued development

In the future, I plan to add a GUI to the Sudoku solver program to make it more user-friendly.
