# Sudoku-Solver
<<<<<<< HEAD
This project is a Java-based Sudoku solver that uses the concepts of backtracking, 2D arrays, and recursion to solve any given 9x9 Sudoku puzzle. The solver efficiently fills in the empty cells by recursively trying potential solutions and backtracking when conflicts arise, ensuring that all Sudoku rules are met.

## Overview

<<<<<<< HEAD
The Sudoku solver program is designed to solve Sudoku puzzles using backtracking. The program prompts the user to enter a 9x9 grid, with each cell containing a number between 1 and 9. Empty cells should be represented by a 0. Once the puzzle is entered, the program solves it using backtracking and displays the solution.
=======
The Sudoku solver program is designed to solve Sudoku puzzles using backtracking. The program provides a web-based interface where users can input a 9x9 grid, with each cell containing a number between 1 and 9. Empty cells should be left blank. Once the puzzle is entered, the program solves it using backtracking and displays the solution.

## My process

- Algorithm: The program uses a backtracking algorithm to efficiently solve Sudoku puzzles. It explores possible solutions step by step, backtracking when a solution is no longer valid.
<<<<<<< HEAD
- User Interface: A simple text-based interface allows users to input Sudoku puzzles row by row. Users can use 0 to represent empty cells and separate digits with spaces or tabs.
=======
- User Interface: A simple web-based interface allows users to input Sudoku puzzles by clicking on cells and typing numbers.

- Solving: Once the input puzzle is provided, the program processes it and displays the solved Sudoku grid.
- Variable Difficulty: The solver is capable of solving puzzles with varying difficulty levels, making it suitable for both beginners and experienced Sudoku enthusiasts.
