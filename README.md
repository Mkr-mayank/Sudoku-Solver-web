# Sudoku-Solver
This project is a JavaScript-based Sudoku solver that uses the concepts of backtracking, 2D arrays, and recursion to solve any given 9x9 Sudoku puzzle. The solver efficiently fills in the empty cells by recursively trying potential solutions and backtracking when conflicts arise, ensuring that all Sudoku rules are met.

## Overview

The Sudoku solver program is designed to solve Sudoku puzzles using backtracking. The program provides a web-based interface where users can input a 9x9 grid, with each cell containing a number between 1 and 9. Empty cells should be left blank. Once the puzzle is entered, the program solves it using backtracking and displays the solution.

### The challenge

The challenge of this project was to implement the backtracking algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles. The backtracking algorithm is a common algorithm used to solve Sudoku puzzles.

## My process

- Algorithm: The program uses a backtracking algorithm to efficiently solve Sudoku puzzles. It explores possible solutions step by step, backtracking when a solution is no longer valid.
- User Interface: A simple web-based interface allows users to input Sudoku puzzles by clicking on cells and typing numbers.
- Solving: Once the input puzzle is provided, the program processes it and displays the solved Sudoku grid.
- Variable Difficulty: The solver is capable of solving puzzles with varying difficulty levels, making it suitable for both beginners and experienced Sudoku enthusiasts.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### What I learned

Through this project, I learned:
- How to implement the backtracking algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles in JavaScript
- How to create a dynamic web-based interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- How to handle user input and manipulate the DOM in JavaScript

### Continued development

In the future, I plan to:
- Improve the user interface with more features, such as highlighting conflicts
- Add functionality to generate Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulty
- Include animations and visual effects to enhance the user experience
